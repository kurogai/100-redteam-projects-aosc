# TCP server just to receive messages
>This simple TCP server receives messages and echoes them back to the client. The client program sets up its socket differently from the way a server does. Instead of binding to a port and listening, it uses connect() to attach the socket directly to the remote address.

NOTE: Make sure that the terminals running the scripts are separate
